# ExpressionsMaskWrenchWatchdogs2
Made a fun expressions / emotes mask from the game character Wrench in "WatchDogs 2", Uses 8x8 LED matrix an a microcontroller board to show custom expressions on the mask, It was a fun project.

Used Arduino and a LED matrix programming lib to make custom emotes and display them on the "eyes" part of the mask. The project can definately be made more portable and lighter, a good improvement would be to scan the subjects face for expressions, run expression classification on it and then generate a new emote for that moment. Great idea for a college/high school mechatronic assignment.
